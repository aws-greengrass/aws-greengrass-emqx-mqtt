CMake Error at cda_integration/CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findaws-crt-cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "aws-crt-cpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "aws-crt-cpp" with
  any of the following names:

    aws-crt-cppConfig.cmake
    aws-crt-cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "aws-crt-cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "aws-crt-cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "aws-crt-cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
